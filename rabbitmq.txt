# RabbitMQ

# Running it on localhost:15672
-> go to C:\Program Files\RabbitMQ Server\rabbitmq_server-3.9.11\sbin
-> ls to see all .bat scripts files
-> rabbitmq-plugins.bat enable rabbitmq_management
-> you can enable/disable it

# What is message and why we need it ?
-> SOAP protocol has message, header and body
-> asynchronous, different for a synchronous http request
-> example:
-> customers messages, orders comming in a huge load
-> we can process them one by one
-> we use advanced messaging to encapsulate any kind of information
-> queues, topics, channels, exchanges, depends on the protocol definition

# Messaging Protocols
-> most used are STOMP, MQTT and MQP
-> STOMP is a text-oriented messaging protocols (simple messages)
-> MQTT macchine to machine
-> AMQP is advanced messaging protocols protocol

# What AMQP solves ?
-> completely different systems to exchange messages
-> vendor A publishes the message to broker and vendor B receives the message from broker  
-> diverse programming languages can communicate easily
-> enables messaging as a cloud service

# RabbitMQ features
-> supports clustering for fault tolerance and scalability
-> multiple connections in a single TCP connection
-> delegate less process

# Actors of Messaging
-> producer produces a message eich is sent to a exchange
-> through the exchange the message is routed to a queue
-> a consumer recieves the messages from the queue

# Exchanges
-> first to receive the message
-> routes a message to one or more queue
-> routing algorithms dependes on exchange types and "bidings"
-> "biding" is nothing more than a configuration to bind exchanges to queues
-> types:
->
-> direct = empty string and amq.direct
-> fanout = amq.fanout
-> topic = amq.topic (user purchased, for example)
-> headers = amq.match and amq.headers

# Queues
-> messages arrive from exchanges to queues
